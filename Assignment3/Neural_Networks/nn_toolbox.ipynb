    "### Finding the optimal hyperparameters\n",
    "We are going to use grid search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters. We have the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **hidden_layer_sizes**: A list of integers where by the ith element is the number of neurons in the ith hidden layer.\n",
    " - **activation**: Activation function for the hidden layer. You have the following options:\n",
    "\t - 'identity' $f(x) = x$\n",
    "\t - 'logistic' $f(x) = \\frac{1}{ 1 + e^{-x}}$\n",
    "\t - 'tanh'  $f(x) = tanh(x)$\n",
    "\t - 'relu' $f(x) = max(0, x)$\n",
    " - **alpha**: L2 penalty (regularization term) parameter.\n",
    " - **solver**: The solver for weight optimization. You have the following options:\n",
    "\t - 'sgd' The original version stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\t - ‘adam’ A specialized version that automaticaly adapts it learning rates over time. Adam is significantly faster then SGD but uses more memory space.\n",
    " - **learning_rate_init**: The initial learning rate used. It controls the step-size in updating the weights.\n",
    " - **max_iter**: Maximum number of epochs (how many times each data point will be used, not the number of gradient steps). The solver iterates until convergence (determined by ‘tol’) or this number of iterations.\n",
    " - **batch_size**:  The size of minibatches that will be given to stochastic optimizer. When set to 'auto', `batch_size=min(200,  n_samples)`\n",
    " - **validation_fraction**: The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for early stopping. This hyperparameters is calculated automitcaly by our notebook, so you should not change this.\n",
    " - **early_stopping**: If set to true, it will terminate the training process when validation score is not improving by at least tol for `n_iter_no_change` consecutive epochs.\n",
    " - **n_iter_no_change**: Maximum number of epochs to not meet `tol` improvement.\n",
    " - **tol**: Tolerance for the optimization. When the loss or score is not improving by at least `tol` for `n_iter_no_change` consecutive iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we have setup up grid search using [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) for Sklearn's [MLPClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html). We have provided you with some default values for each of the hyperparameters. Feel free to try out additional values. You can probably improve the network by finding better values for `hidden_layer_sizes`, `activation`, `alpha` and `learning_rate_init`. You can do this by adding additional values to the list attributes of `grid`. The code below will provide you with the best values in the grid you have defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that the computational cost increases combinatorially with the number of options. Which means that you should be either very patient or you should choose wisely which values you want to try out. The grid search runs multiple training processes in parallel, making it a bit faster. By default this notebook will use all the processes it can get. However, this might be too much for some computers. If this is the case for you change `n_jobs` from `-1` to the number of processes you think is right (at least 1 of course)."

    "### Analysing the best network\n",
    "The grid search has provided us with the network with the best combination of hyperparameters (given our train, validation set and grid). In this section, we analyse this network in multiple aspects. Firstly, we compare the difference between the loss function (Sklearn uses [Multi Class Cross-Entropy](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html#id11) loss), accuracy and MSE on the training and test set. These values should be relatively close else we are overfitting on the training data. Secondly, we look at the training loss and validation curve. These curves will give us some insight into how much epochs we need and if we need to stop earlier or not. Finally, we compare the confusion matrix of the training and test data set. This will give us some insight into which classes the network finds hard to predict and which classes generalize less well."
